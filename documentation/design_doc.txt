Flashcards is a fullstack webapp for Flashcards. 

Goals:

	- have a list of categories and subcategories
	- have flashcards
	- render latex
	- run good on desktop and mobile 

	- HTML/CSS/Javascript
	- Node.js, Express.js
	- MySql


Software Architecture: 

This App is essentially just a GUI representation of our Flashcard
data. The App logic pertains mainly to how the GUI should look, 
populating content, and styling the content. 

We will be using Responsive design(Fluid Grids, Flexible Images, 
and Media Queries).

It should look something like this:
-------------------------------------------
All					|	What is a GUI?
Beginner			|	What is a pixel?
	Documentation	|	Give an example of a loop structure in...
	Example			|	What is recursion in computer science?
Intermediate		|	Why is documentation important in prog...
	Database		|	What should good documentation include?
	...				|			...
--------------------------------------------

The GUI is a vertical splitscreen with a hierarchy of ul/li in the 
left pane to hold categories, and the right pane is a list of 
flashcards for the associated category. 

Clicking on a category brings up all the flash cards for that 
category. Clicking on on a flashcard's question will bring up an 
overlay with the flashcard. The flash card can be flipped by 
selecting it and the overlay can be closed by clicking/touching 
outsidethe Flashcard.

The backend is in express and serves the pages and creates the 
CRUD routes for the fetch operations. 
	routes:
	 - get_flashcards
	 - get_categories (category_id)

The Database schema has two tables.
(1) The Category table is an adjacency pattern to have a hierarchy 
of categories. 
(2) The Flashcard table contains a front and back field, and a 
foreign key to a category.
